Question 1:
The algorithm removes elements from the array that
are less than k, and creates a new array with the new elements
and sums them

Question 3:

def better-algo-x(A,k):
    N = []
    for a in A:
        if a >= k:
            N.append(a)
    
    sum = 0
    for n in N:
        sum += N
    
    return sum
