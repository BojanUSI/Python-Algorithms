Q1:

The decision problem is in P. A solution with complexity
O (n^2) exists.

A(k, l):

    C = [0] * |P|

    for i from 1 to |P|:
        p_x = P[i]

        for j from 1 to |P|:
            p_y = P[j]

            if KNOWS(p_x, p_y):
                C[i] = C[i] + 1
    
    c = 0

    for i from 1 to |P|:

        if C[i] >= l:
            c = c + 1
    
    if c >= k:
        return True
    else return False


The decision problem is in NP. Providing a verification algorithm and an additional
subset of P, T which has the same size as k and it is checked whether every person
in T is a stranger.

A(k):

    if |T| > k or |T| < k:
        return False
    else:
        for every p_t1 in T:
            for every p_t2 in T:
                if KNOWS(p_t1, p_t2):
                    return False
    
    return True
